Below   is   an   excerpt   from   Terazono   (2022):
One of   Europe’s leading meat companies is to build a £100mn production   facility   in   the UK   as the   country’s   appetite for bacon surges. Danish Crown will build the plant in Rochdale, north   of   Manchester.   ...   The new facility will allow it to sell its bacon   and   gammon processed in   the UK   made   from   imported   Danish pork.
The UK already has the highest consumption of   bacon per capita in   Europ代 写INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND THE WORLD ECONOMY (MMM143)Java

The market has remained one of   Danish Crown’s   important   export   destinations,   with   its   bacon   business   in   the   UK   worth   an   annual   £600mn   (see   picture   below). 
The company, which is owned by a farming   co-operative, has been   exporting bacon to   the UK   since   1887,   and   its sales have remained steady despite Brexit, the chief   executive   added,   although   it has meant that   it   has   to produce an additional 33,000 sets of   documents   a year to   trade.   He   described the process   as   “crazy”, before   adding that as a large company it was manageable.   “We   can   do   it.   But,   of   course,   small   and   medium-sized companies are struggling with this kind of   bureaucracy issue,” he   said. 
2.   Relying on the two scatterplots below (from   Lendle   et   al.,   2016)   and   arguments   developed in the module, critically discuss the   following   statement:   “eBay   can help defy the gravity   law of trade”   .
Note:The two scatterplots show the relationship between distance from the US   and   import   in the   US for a large number of   country-product pairs. The scatterplot   on the   left   focuses   on trade   occurring on eBay, while the one on the right   shows the   Total trade.
